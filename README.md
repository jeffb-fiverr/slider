## This repository uses semantic versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, 
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

To accomplish this, run `gulp bump:patch`, `gulp bump:minor` and `gulp bump:major` accordingly
